    "Solution": "Employ the self-instruct paradigm to generate synthetic instruction data. This involves providing a few in-context examples along with reference API documentation to a powerful LLM (e.g., GPT-4) and tasking it to generate real-world use cases that call upon the API. The generated instruction-API pairs are then used to finetune a base LLM (e.g., LLaMA) in a user-agent chat-style conversation format.",
